# CampusTransport-UNRC-2025

Repository for the **Project 2025** course at UNRC. The goal is to develop an app that connects drivers and passengers within the campus, optimizing trips so that drivers don’t deviate much from their routes. A *Reinforcement Learning* algorithm will decide which passengers are worth picking up based on their location and route.

## Key Features

- **Free system**; no payments or cost-sharing are considered.  
- Any university member can register as a **driver** or **passenger**; roles can be switched at any time.  
- Route optimization using *Reinforcement Learning* to approach results similar to **Dijkstra/A\***.  
- Development methodology: **Scrum**.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** React + Tailwind + Vite + TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Python + Flask + Pytest  
- **AI/ML:** numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow, keras  
- **Street Graphs:** OpenStreetMap + osmnx  

## Contribution

- We will follow **1–2 week Scrum sprints**, including retrospectives with course instructors.
