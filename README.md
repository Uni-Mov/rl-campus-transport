# rl-campus-transport
Repository for the Project 2025 course at UNRC. We are developing an app that connects drivers and passengers on campus, optimizing trips so that drivers donâ€™t deviate much from their route. A Reinforcement Learning algorithm will decide which passengers are worth picking up based on their location and route.
